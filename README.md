# Diversity
This library contains 6 diversity algorithms used in the paper "Analyzing research diversity of scholars based on multi-dimensional calculation of knowledge entities". 
The complete experiment process includes many data preprocessing and calculation processes related to papers, authors and entities, and also includes very large data files. We consider gradually improving them in the future so that users can better understand PubMed Knowledge Graph (this is the outcome of our team published on Nature-Scientific Data, and it has been verified to have good author disambiguation and entity extraction effects).
