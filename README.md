# Diversity
This library contains 6 diversity algorithms used in the paper "Analyzing research diversity of scholars based on multi-dimensional calculation of knowledge entities". 

The complete experiment process includes many data preprocessing and calculation processes related to papers, authors and entities. In order to quickly obtain results in large data, the codes are not written in the form of functions. The experiment process also uses very large data files, which can be more streamlined to help users use it.

We will gradually improving them in the future so that users can better understand the PubMed Knowledge Graph (this is the outcome of our team published on Nature-Scientific Data, and it has been verified to have good author disambiguation and entity extraction performance).
